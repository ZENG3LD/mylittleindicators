//! Composite-detector primitives.
//!
//! Primitives are indicators whose own logic detects a SIGNAL/EVENT from
//! the interaction of OHLCV data with N inner indicator outputs. Unlike
//! plain composite indicators (Bollinger, MACD) that produce continuous
//! scalar values, primitives produce event-shaped outputs
//! (`IndicatorValue::Signal(i8)`, `Flag`, `DoubleFlag`, etc.).
//!
//! Each primitive owns its inner indicators via `Box<IndicatorInstance>`
//! and drives them in lock-step with the host bar stream. Dedup happens
//! at the slice-cache layer through `IndicatorKey.param_hash` which folds
//! inner-indicator configs recursively.
